    Handsome registered German shepherd Arman is looking for a new home. Arma has a high watchdog, so when guests arrive, the boy has to welcome them in his own style, sniffing carefully. After confirming that the visitors are harmless, he goes on with his own activities. Arman came to the association to look for a home due to a change in the owner's living situation.
    Arman is a very friendly, loyal, pleasing boy who loves active activities. Needs a firm and consistent owner, easily takes the reins into his own paws if he senses that he is getting the better of things and then living together can become difficult if the dog does not listen to his owner. Not suitable as a first dog.
    Arman does not get along well with other dogs, so he is only placed as an only pet. On a leash, the boy walks nicely, making contact with his handler, but when he sees other dogs, he starts barking. You still need training for using a leash so that overtaking goes smoothly and jogging becomes a relaxed and enjoyable activity for both of you. In the foster home, we have started to train walking on a leash with other dogs for a short distance, after the initial enthusiasm and noises, he is already able to concentrate on receiving commands and walks most of the time by his owner's side without rushing to other dogs.
    Being alone has gone without any problems, he hasn't caused havoc or barked on his own, plenty of exercise and activation has helped his calm behavior indoors, allowing you to focus on peaceful rest. Arman has been photographed at the vet, which revealed a suspicion of mild cauda equina syndrome, which does not require any measures at this stage. Hasn't been in pain in a foster home, but Armani is not into any heavy hobby. Exercise and light hobbies, such as nose jobs, are highly recommended. Forest walks are pleasant for the boy, a quiet environment with as few distractions as possible, then Arman is at his best.
    We are looking for an adult home for Armani in a detached house in a quiet residential area, and the prospective home is expected to have experience with German shepherds or other service dog breeds. The future home must commit to taking care of the dog's daily ample amount of exercise, activation and training. Not placed in a family with children. Arman is clean inside and in a foster home in Vihti where he can get to know the boy as agreed.

  description: Diego, a handsome and friendly bullmastiff mix, pawed at the association to find a home due to a change in his owner's life situation. Diego has a watchman at home, so the foster home receives the guests outside first, after which they are introduced to Diego when they come inside. After examining the guests and finding them harmless, after a while the tail wags and the master is begging for crackers. Diego gets along with other dogs differently, which is why Mr. is placed as the only dog. Life with the cat goes smoothly, sometimes the master tries to get the cat to play with him, but without success. Gets along with school-aged children. In the mornings when the children from the foster home are escorted to school, Diego is excited to be greeted by everyone who goes to school. Friendly block, with which you sometimes need patience and a sense of humor when the object is the sofa in the living room. In the Lord's opinion, he can stretch out on the couch very widely and the others can go wherever there is room. On a leash, Diego mainly walks nicely, can get a little excited to chase after smells, and this Lord has strength. You don't bark at other dogs on a leash, you can only bark back if the other one starts barking. Alone from the Lord is going without any problems, hasn't caused any damage and waits nicely while the others leave. In the car, you also travel nicely in your own place without making a fuss, and you don't get sick. Diego has a special diet that must be followed for the rest of his life. We are looking for a home for Diego, either in a terraced house or a detached house in a quiet residential area, and the future home must commit to taking care of the dog's daily exercise, about the need for activation and training. Not placed as the first dog or in a family with very small children, Diego is used to life with school-aged children. Clean inside.

  description: Multiracial Floki is looking for a new home. Floki and his brother Figo are a speedy duo whose owner had to give up due to a change in life situation. Floki is calmer than his brothers and explores a bit further back first until he paws his way into the action. A bit more shy in nature, but can be easily lured into playing. A very friendly boy who gets along with other dogs, a cat and school-aged children. Puppies are placed separately and only with the female dog as a companion to avoid possible later problems. Floki is very studious, has the patience to practice commands better than his brother, can already sit and wait when asked. Travels well in the car in its own transport cabin, is not nauseous or noisy. Floki's parents are 40cm in size and weigh approx. 10-13kg, so the puppies are expected to grow to about the same size. Floki is primarily looking for a home in a terraced house or detached house, and the future home requires a commitment to the puppy's training, socialization and taking care of the dog's daily exercise and activation. The interior cleanliness is already in good shape, but damage can still happen, so the future home must be prepared for this.

  description: Young and energetic rottweiler mix Koda is looking for a home. Koda came to the association to look for a home due to a change in the owner's living situation. Koda is very friendly towards people, welcomes guests cheerfully, may also jump at you, so newcomers should be prepared for this. In addition to rottweilers, Koda's pedigree includes pit bulls, he needs a lot of training and activation to stay happy, Koda is not just a couch potato. Knows some basic commands, but requires a firm and consistent owner to accept commands. Koda doesn't really respect or listen to the tyrant if he feels he's getting even a little bit of a hand in things. He walks quite nicely on the leash until another dog appears in sight, when he starts barking and attacking. Also darts after flying leaves or, inspired by an interesting smell, changes direction to surprise the catcher. Leash use is Koda's biggest problem, and it is worked on daily in the foster home so that jogging runs smoothly in the future. Can be easily motivated with treats or a chew bar in training and contact search. The socialization of the home has remained somewhat incomplete, due to the young age this is also something that can still be corrected. In the foster home, I have met older bitches of the same size jogging together, and the jogging went great. Koda could perfectly read the sign language of the older bitches, so there were no problems. The solitary exercises have started and the short periods have gone without any problems, the time interval is gradually being extended. The boy travels fine in the car, doesn't get sick or make unnecessary noise. We are looking for an adult home for Koda as the only pet in a terraced or detached house in a quiet residential area, and the future home requires a lot of dog and training experience, Koda is not suitable as a first dog. The future home must commit to taking care of the dog's ample amount of exercise, activation and training every day in order to avoid possible problems caused by frustration. Koda would certainly also be suitable for a hobby where you can release your energy and activate your nose and head. Koda is clean inside and in a foster home in Helsinki, where you can get to know the boy as agreed.
- name: Minttu
  species: Multiracial
  birthdate: 02.09.2019
  sex: female
  description: Sweet multi-breed Minttu is looking for a new home. First of all, I have to say that Minttu is not a normal little dog. Minttu is very shy and it takes time to get used to new people. Minttu doesn't happily jump up to you or curl up in arms, but I still believe that if you find the right person, Minttu can live a very good dog's life if you understand the soul life of a timid dog. The girl gets along with other dogs, a small, calm and social dog friend would be best for Mintu. The girl needs a friend by her side whose example she could follow in normal everyday life. It's also fine with a cat, if the cat is used to dogs. Minttu is not placed in a family with children due to his shyness and lack of familiarity with children. Minttu needs time from its future owner, trust is not won with a couple of treats, but with time. Being alone with the girl goes without any problems, she doesn't do any damage and doesn't make a fuss. Minttu goes outside when asked, but outdoor activities can end very soon when interrupted by a loud noise, in which case the girl's only goal is to get indoors. In the previous home, the walks outside were really short when the dog was almost in a state of panic and the needs came running in circles. For this reason, Mintus had to be given up because life in a busy residential environment is not suitable for the girl and the days were full of stress. Minttu is currently in a foster home in the countryside, where outdoor activities are calmer and the girl is more liberated in a suitable environment. Mintu is looking for an adult home in a detached house in the countryside, and the future home is expected to have experience with very timid dogs. Minttu is clean inside and in a foster home in Pukkila, where you can meet the girl as agreed. In the case of an Ara dog, it would be good to meet the dog at least twice with the future home before the decision to repatriate. The girl is 30 cm tall and weighs a good 5 kg. The mint was originally imported privately from Russia.

The girl pulls on the leash and this problem has started to be worked out in the foster home. Makes good contact and listens to commands, is very interested in approaching dogs, however does not show aggressive signs, is more excited about other dogs. Cars or bikes passing by while running can rev up the Milla and try to attack them. Milla is very close to people and really enjoys the company of people, when she is alone she barks, but she hasn't done any damage. Very interested in different smells, so Milla could very well fit into a hobby that requires nose work. Has its own watchdog and barks to announce the arrival of guests. You might jump against the newcomers, and you can unintentionally hurt yourself with your eagerness. Not placed in a family with children due to energy. Milla is looking for an adult home in a detached house, in a quiet residential area, and the new home should have a fenced yard where the girl could not only jog but also unleash her passion for running. The future home must commit to taking care of the dog's daily plenty of exercise, activation and training.
