Do you have a fenced yard? Do you have children? Do you have other pets? Do you have a lot of energy? Do you have a lot of time?\nAfter you have answered all those questions for the staff and for yourself and you would be given permission to adopt a dog, now the big decision of chosing the right dog comes into play.\nThere are so many factors that you will need to take into consideration before choosing your perfect dog.\nDon’t just take the first one you like and really evaluate who would be the right fit for you and your family.\nIt often helps to leave the kids at home for the first visit because the “love at first sight” symptom is extremely common for children.\nRemember that a dog is a lifetime commitment and not only for a few months.\nResearch as much as possible about certain breeds, dog training and dog behavior before you make your final decision."},{"id":"a1627edd-4882-4f9b-96f6-8eab1335abe4","question":"Tips for first time dog adopters","answer":"Now that you have evaluated that you are ready to adopt a dog and you have even decided on a shelter or rescue center, it is now time to meet your future companion.\nYou have probably preselected a few dogs during your first visit. Make sure to schedule a meeting or several sessions with each of these dogs to get to know them properly.\nFollow the meet-n-greet protocol of your local dog shelter or the advice of a staff member on how you should approach the dog and which way to interact with him best.\nWatch the body language and behavior closely when the dog is being brought to you on a leash.\nBUT: Don’t pay too much attention if he is pulling out of excitement. This is definitely a very stressful and exciting situation for everyone. Evaluate if you could train leash-pulling though.\nPay attention to how he walks by the other dogs and people. Is he lunging, growling, or barking?\nThen he might have a reactivity issue which you should address immediately.\nHow does the dog interact with you? Is he quickly running up and wagging the  does he seem to be more reserved?\nNone of these options is better than the other, it will just give you a first impression on how the dog reacts towards strangers.\nTry to engage with him into any sort of play and see how much he desires to interact with you.\nAfter a few sessions of tug of war or fetch, stop the game and ignore him for a while. You will want to see how easily he can settle down again after excitement.\nThis will give you a first idea of how the dog deals with frustration as well as impulse control and attachment."},{"id":"858072c5-91ea-4cd1-be9a-f6ee715ce460","question":"Red flags for dog adopters","answer":"Although rescues and animal shelters are all caring for pets in need, their practices are not always ethical and you should be looking out for the black sheep.\nThere are a few warning signs you should be aware of when choosing the right dog as well as the rescue center.\nTheir dog’s potential future and health should be the highest priority which should reflect in different assessments, screenings, vet care, and post-adoption support."},{"id":"00d13637-ab9e-4819-be9e-b572a812beea","question":"Checklist for new dog adopters","answer":"1.

Right in the car, he might bark, whine, vomit or even urinate out of excitement depending on his temperament.\nBe very calm and don’t overreact to car sickness or any other stress symptom. Approach your dog with understanding and consider the negative experiences he had in the past.\nClose up all the rooms with doors or baby gates to not overwhelm your dog with the whole house.\nOver the next couple of days you can show him around but limiting his explorations to only one room, in the beginning, will take away a lot of stress.\nOver the next couple of days and weeks, ensure that your dog is getting enough physical exercise as well as mental stimulation while revealing to him more and more of his living environment."},{"id":"d2a04c91-f0b6-4846-9608-632c5278adb7","question":"Mistakes dog adopters make","answer":"Like anyone, you will probably make a few mistakes with your new dog and that’s okay. But I can tell you a few very common mistakes so you won’t have to be guilty of them too.\nSpoiling the dog – I know that he had a horrible past without anyone being there to offer him  love.\nBut showering him with kisses and highvalue treats will completely overwhelm him. Going from one day of isolation to another in a loving family is a hard switch.\nHe will quickly become very attached to you in an anxious way. Leaving you will let him feel stressed and uneasy.\nGo slowly with it and take your time introducing different parts of his new life so he will be confident when being on his own.\nGiving too much freedom too early – This is the reason why I have told you to limit his access to the new house in the beginning.\nIt’s not easy to digest a brand new environment, with new people and strange scents all at once. Every dog needs boundaries to feel comfortable.\nNot sticking to the rules – Before you bring home any dog, you should have laid out a set of rules that everyone in the family has to agree upon and enforce.\nIf you don’t want your dog on the furniture then establish it from the very first second.\nDogs do not understand exceptions like children do. They are habitual creatures and jumping on  will become a habit very quickly.\nIf you don’t want your dog to get into the bathroom, then never leave the door open for him unsupervised.\nNot providing your dog with the right type of activity – In the beginning, a lot of this exercise will consist of him exploring and sniffing his new environment on a long leash.\nGet familiar with his exercise needs and preferences and don’t force him to do anything he doesn’t want.\nYou don’t need to be jogging if your dog would rather play fetch and he doesn’t have to go for a swim if he would rather search for.\nOverexercising is just as fatal as underexercising your dog so you will have to find the golden middle."}]
